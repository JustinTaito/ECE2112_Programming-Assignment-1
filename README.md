# ECE2112_Programming-Assignment-1
Advance Computer Programming SY 2025-2026
- Name: Ruiz, Justin Danrei C || 2ECE-C
I. Intended Learning Outcomes:
    To identify the basic codes and functions in Python Programming
    To be able to apply the different codes and functions in creating a Python program


## Contents of this Assignment:
- Contains the assignment of Programming Assignment, with 3 problems:
   1. Alphabet Soup Problem - A program that sorts the letter of a word alphabetically
   2. Emoticon Problem - A program that checks a sentence and replaces emotion words with emoticons/emojis
   3. Unpacking list - A program that shows the first list, the last element, and the rest as a middle element of the list
## Why it's useful:
- Alphabet Soup Problem explores the creative use of sorting operations and the use of lists
- Emoticon Problem explores how we can use the replace or get operation
- A useful way to define a variable using the index (as well as a negative index)
Personal Reflection:
- Python is quite difficult to learn for me compared to C++, which is odd because the majority agree that Python is easier. I hope that I'll continue to learn more in Python

## How to run:
1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open the .ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook, preferably in the latest version
3. Run all cells in order to test the program
