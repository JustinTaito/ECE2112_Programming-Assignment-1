# ECE2112_Programming-Assignment-1
Advance Computer Programming SY 2025-2026
- Name: Ruiz, Justin Danrei C || 2ECE-C
- Intended Learning Outcomes:
  1. To identify the codes and functions incorporated in the Numpy library
  2. To be able to apply and use the different codes and functions in creating a Python program using a
Numpy library
## 📝Contents of this Assignment 📝
- Contains the assignment of the Programming Assignment, with 2 problems, each of which includes its respective .npy file.
   1. **Normalization Problem** - A program that creates a random 5 x 5 ndarray and stores it in a variable X, and normalizes X. The ndarray array will then be saved as X_normalized.npy
   2. **Divisible by 3 Problem** - A program that creates a following 10 x 10 ndarray, which are the squares of the first 100 positive integers. From the ndarray, it will determine all the elements that are divisible by 3, the result will be saved as div_by_3.py.
## 💭 Why it's useful 💭
- Normalization problem teaches us and allows us to use the skill of normalization, which we will be using when it comes to statistics in data or matrices.
- Divisible by 3 problem teaches us how to determine the elements that are divisible by a certain number, which is very applicable to alot of problems that we will need to solve.
## Personal Notes
- I use several resources online in my coding assignment; however, I try to use the code from the Basic Computing.ipynb and Numpy.ipynb as much as possible
## 📁How to run 📁
1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open the .ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook, preferably in the latest version
3. Run all cells in order to test the program
